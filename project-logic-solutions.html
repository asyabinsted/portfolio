New users required special training that took a long time to understand how everything worked, and tracking shipments was slow and error-prone.</p>

                                <p class="text-nav color-foreground">I created a single flow where any authorized user could start a shipment â€” from sales, customer request, or operations â€” all leading to the same shared record. To reduce errors and save time, the flow:</p>

                                    <li>Starts with only a few required parameters (operation type, transport mode, service type) to generate a shipment reference.</li>
                                    <li>Guides users step by step through a "journey," replacing manual workflows with clear pages grouped by logic (basic info, owners, stakeholders, shipment details, locations, services).</li>
                                    <li>Allows reusing previous shipments as templates instead of starting from scratch.</li>
                                    <li>Supports automation: repeated fields are auto-filled, detailed packing lists can be uploaded and parsed, and calculations (like container volume) are done automatically.</li>
                                    <li>Provides an AI assistant that retrieves data from emails and documents, highlights conflicts, and suggests missing information â€” while still leaving users in control to review and confirm.</li>

                            <li><span class="text-highlight">Onboarding is design work</span>: I realized that many of the frustrations users faced weren't about logistics itself but about how hard it was to learn the tool. Reducing training time by making flows clearer was one of the most valuable design outcomes.</li>
                            <li><span class="text-highlight">Flexibility needs boundaries</span>: users in logistics often have different habits and priorities, so the system had to adapt. But unlimited freedom quickly becomes chaos. I learned how to design options and customizations while still keeping the product coherent.</li>
                            <li><span class="text-highlight">Design lives between people and systems</span>: talking to users gave me one view of their struggles, but looking at how systems communicated with each other showed another. Bridging both sides was key to making the product useful.</li>

                        <p class="text-page color-foreground">The platform in use at the time had started as an accounting tool and gradually grew to support multiple departments. Over time, it became powerful and feature-rich, but also complex and hard to use.</p>
                        
                        <p class="text-page color-foreground">While it worked reliably and offered many functions, it had major limitations. It was built in the early 2000s on technology that made changes difficult and restricted design improvements. Navigation was confusing, workflows were manual, tasks had to be repeated, and information was scattered. New users required special training that took a long time to understand how everything worked, and tracking shipments was slow and error-prone.</p>
                        
                        <p class="text-page color-foreground">My task was to design a platform for all agents in the logistics process, with the goal of easing onboarding on a complex system. The aim was to help new users get started quickly, understand workflows easily, reduce repeated work, and make information simple to find and manage.</p>

                        <p class="text-page color-foreground">To understand the challenges of freight forwarding, I first studied the rules and regulations involved in moving goods across countries. I analyzed other systems to see how similar workflows were handled and talked with users to learn how tasks were actually performed.</p>
                        
                        <p class="text-page color-foreground">I decoded data from other platforms to ensure the design would work with existing systems and information flows. I created low-fidelity wireframes to explore ideas and test them early with users. Later, I developed hi-fidelity interactive prototypes to simulate real interactions and gather feedback on usability before development.</p>
                        
                        <p class="text-page color-foreground">I conducted user interviews, mapped workflows, ran surveys to collect feedback, and tested different solutions. These steps helped shape a platform where workflows matched how people actually worked, tasks were automated or streamlined, information was centralized so work was less fragmented, and different agents could access the shipment information relevant to them.</p>

                                <p class="text-nav color-foreground">Creating a shipment was fragmented and repetitive. Sales, operations, and other agents entered the same information in different systems, which increased errors and slowed work. Each user had their own way of handling the process, making training and onboarding long and inconsistent.</p>

                                <h3 class="shipment-creation-block-title text-nav color-foreground">DESIGN</h3>
                                <p class="text-nav color-foreground">I created a single flow where any authorized user could start a shipment — from sales, customer request, or operations — all leading to the same shared record. To reduce errors and save time, the flow:</p>
                                <ul class="text-nav color-foreground">
                                    <li>Starts with only a few required parameters (operation type, transport mode, service type) to generate a shipment reference.</li>
                                    <li>Guides users step by step through a "journey," replacing manual workflows with clear pages grouped by logic (basic info, owners, stakeholders, shipment details, locations, services).</li>
                                    <li>Allows reusing previous shipments as templates instead of starting from scratch.</li>
                                    <li>Supports automation: repeated fields are auto-filled, detailed packing lists can be uploaded and parsed, and calculations (like container volume) are done automatically.</li>
                                    <li>Provides an AI assistant that retrieves data from emails and documents, highlights conflicts, and suggests missing information — while still leaving users in control to review and confirm.</li>
